      <p>I started back at work today, albeit from the comfort of my couch. I could have started last week with no issues, but I figured taking a staycation would be good for my soul.</p>

<p>I had a beer with some folks from the climbing gym. They talked a lot about problems they were working on, miming the beta that they had worked out.</p>

<p>It bummed me out to hear that – only because I wanted to jump on those routes and do them. I started thinking that, even if I come back, I might only be capable of really simple jug hauls. That doesn't seem like a whole lot of fun.</p>

<p>Climbing became a big part of who I am and it’s something I really enjoy. To think that I might not ever be able to climb again (especially at hard grades) really disappoints me.</p>

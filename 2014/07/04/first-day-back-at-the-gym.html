      <p>Oh man! I thawed my membership at <a href="http://trianglerockclub.com">TRC</a> and went in for a solid hangboard session. It's amazing how much more fun and motivating it is to train in a gym compared to at home. The environment just seems more conducive to trying hard and staying psyched.</p>

<p>I went through an ad hoc series of drills, mostly focused around pyramids on the Beastmaker 1000 and a Moonboard. Like earlier workouts, I threw in some walking lockoffs and frenchies for fun. While playing around today, I realized I can lock off on either arm. I'm not quite at 90ยบ, but I'm not that far off. Doing this made me remember my first human flag, which I did at <a href="http://climbprogression.com">Progression</a> the week before all this started. </p>

<p>This visit today reinvigorated me. I feel like I will be able to get strong while I recuperate. I can't wait for my <a href="http://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/">training manual</a> to get here!</p>

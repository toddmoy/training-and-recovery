      <p>My copy of RCTP is in the mail, but I can't wait. To get a head start, I'm acquainting myself with some of the concepts Mark outlines on his blog. Here's my notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Periodization</strong> - Scheduling different phases of training to reach a performance peak at a predetermined time.
    <ul>
      <li>The RPTP is three-to-four months long, which leads to three-to-four cycles per year.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Phases:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Training
        <ul>
          <li>Base</li>
          <li>Strength</li>
          <li>Power</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Performance
        <ul>
          <li>Power-Endurance</li>
          <li>Sending</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Rest</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Phase Length</strong> - between two-to-five weeks, with most in the three-to-four week range.
    <ul>
      <li>Should vary on the climber's training experience, the needs of the phase, and the climber's goals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Transition Phase</strong> - one-to-two week gradient between power / performance phases.</li>
  <li><strong>Whole Body Strength Training</strong> - supplemental exercises during strength phase. Types: pulling, shoulders, upper arm, core.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal Setting</strong> is an important precursor that helps shape your training program by identifying specific challenges to address.
    <ul>
      <li>Should be very discrete and clear. "Send Apollo Reed" rather than "Send 5.13"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Training Efficiency</strong> - it's important to maximize improvement relative to training time.
    <ul>
      <li>Repeated low efficiency activities increase recovery time, sapping energy from high efficiency activities. This can result in the climber struggling to maintain fitness.</li>
      <li>RPTP favors high intensity training and minimal cross-training.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Power Training</strong> - designed to increase the amount of force that can be applied in a short period of time.
    <ul>
      <li>Increases fiber-contraction speed.</li>
      <li>Increases intramuscular coordination and spatial awareness.</li>
      <li>Two fundamental exercises: limit bouldering and campusing.</li>
      <li>Number of repetitions is small but intensity is high.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <p>This was a week of firsts. </p>

<p>On Wednesday, I started walking again. On Saturday, I started working the campus ladder. Those are two positive improvements that I'm really happy to see.</p>

<p>Walking is both challenging and not. It's strange. I'm hyperaware that it's hard and that it hurts. The pain isn't fierce or piercing, but dull and arthritic. When I walk, I notice my tendency to counter-compensate away from the pain. I employed the same technique prior to my hip replacement and I'm really cautious not depend on that, lest I breed new (bad) habits.</p>

<p>I hope the pain subsides with activity. I added a new element to my training program: walking around the block. While it's a pretty lame activity, it's absolutely essential. </p>

<p>At the gym yesterday and today, I started working campus ladders. Holy shit, how much fun. I guess I've been on the hangboard so long that I forgot how good it feels to ascend something. In my training plan, I started with matched ladders but soon found those to be too easy. Now, I'm just alternating hands with a set of pullups at the top. </p>

<p>In the back of my mind, I'm worried that my ankle will continue to be arthritic. One hint that things might get better is how my ankle felt after walking and climbing today. When I took the boot off, it was stiff-ish, but rolling it around felt good. I could notice the pain, but it was a <em>good pain</em> â€“ a feeling of tightness and soreness coupled with the desire to flex it hard. I've felt this before on other injuries and it's always been a good sign.</p>

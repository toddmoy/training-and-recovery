      <p>Outside. </p>

<p>First day outside in 141 days. </p>

<p>It was top rope and I was shaky for sure. Anxious on the ground, shaky on moves, nervous at the anchors. I felt more scared than usual â€“ and I knew my fall would only be a few inches at most.</p>

<p>I was scared of failing more than anything else. The moves weren't bad, but I wanted more than anything to feel like I was returning to my prior skill level. The routes were moderate and I didn't want to fail.</p>

<p>There's a difference there that I need to get over. Falling isn't failing, even though it seems that way. Falling is a normal element in progression. If you're not falling, you're not progressing. To me though, the two are still entwined. Falling is the last resort when it shouldn't be. I should accept it and let it flow more easily. </p>

<p>Anyways.</p>

<p>Being outside was so good. It reminded me that there's so much more to climbing beyond sending or working routes. Sitting in the sun. Cheering on friends. Sitting in the dirt eating sweet pears. Admiring a river cutting through a canyon. Those things I missed.</p>

<p>I think I'm on the way back to them. </p>

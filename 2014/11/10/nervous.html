      <p>I didn't expect to keep this blog going. </p>

<p>But I haven't published the new blog, so here's where this post is going to go. Today, I went out to Pilot with Anna and did a number of routes in the sub 12 range. For some unexplicable reason, I could not keep my nerves down. I was on toprope, so I shouldn't have had an issue. Yet, I kept feeling panicky and desperate. As a result, I didn't lead anything.</p>

<p>While I don't really understand what's going on, I think today was instructive. Things I need to work on are: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Breathing </li>
  <li>Resting</li>
  <li>Footwork</li>
  <li>Reading</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these things was problematic at some point today. More than anything else, I think I should focus on #1 and #2. In particular, I need to work on finding spots where I can rest more easily, regain composure, and move forward feeling confident.</p>

<p>Besides that, I need to fall on lead. Often. I need to reconnect with the experience of falling and remember that it's rarely an issue.</p>

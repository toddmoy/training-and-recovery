<p>So I'm in Boulder and my quick climbing trip got cancelled. Bummer. But at any rate, I revisited this video which got me more psyched than ever to get out and start leading again.</p>

<p>Aside from that, I got the following report from the xray reader: </p>

<p><code>
FINDINGS and IMPRESSION:
Mild heterogeneous mineralization of the talus, in keeping with
healing/healed talar fracture. Talar dome is normal in configuration. No
evidence of avascular necrosis. No new fractures. Congruent ankle mortise.
Preserved joint spaces. Unchanged mild posttraumatic heterotopic
ossification along the distal margin of the medial malleolus. Unremarkable
soft tissues.
</code></p>

<p>TLDR : Good news.</p>

        <p>Fun day climbing. Managed to send a 12- on the first go. </p>

<p>Oh, and the orthopaedist told me that I didn't need to come back. Apparently it all looks great. Seriously, I couldn't have asked for better news. </p>

        <p>Another 12 down. All total, it took three tries in three sessions. I went in with the goal of taking it down and sent it immediately. After that, I one-hung a few new 12s and sent some old ones. </p>

<p>My foot seems to be doing a lot better. While it gets sore still, it usually feels really solid. I think the PT might have strengthened it more than the other ankle.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I go in for my second post-surgery checkup. Fingers crossed that there's no signs of necrosis or anything else.  </p>

        <p>I still haven't gotten back on schedule and that bothers me. But rather than wallow in something unproductive, lets focus on something more interesting. </p>

<p>Today was the first day I started bouldering again.</p>

<p>Because I'm still leery of taking falls or substantial drops, I invented some problems that kept me no more than 4' off the ground. Props to <a href="http://trianglerockclub.com">TRC</a> for having some terrain that makes this possible. </p>

<p>The hangboard and campus training have done some good, but I'm realizing that I need to focus training on actual climbing. Mostly, I feel that I've lost a ton of strength in those unusual positions that come up only on routes – and I need to get that back.</p>

        <p>Last week, my schedule got very disrupted because I was travelling for work. I missed my regular workouts. </p>

<p>My foot is continuing to progress in strength. At the gym today, I spent some time on the inverted balance ball and I could tell things were feeling more stable. </p>

<p>After that (and a hangboard sesh) I set to work on some 12s. </p>

<p>Let's just say that it was a pretty bad day. I strugged up most stuff and failed to complete others. I think the hangboard session before had something to do with this. Nonetheless, I noticed I wasn't getting my body in the right positions often enough. I was also favoring my right foot more than the left, which makes sense.</p>

<p>Overall, I was pretty dissatisfied with the day. Hopefully, the next session won't be as bad.</p>

        <p>A little belated, but whatever. </p>

<p>Over the last few days, I've been up in NY visiting Amy. While I was up there, we hiked Kaaterskill Falls, a one mile out-and-back trail that led to – surprise, surprise – some waterfalls. Good times, great scenery.</p>

<p>I was particularly pumped about how well my ankle did. The trail had a lot of uneven ground that required high-stepping, rock-hopping, careful balancing, and so forth. It was definitely more than I expected and I had a bit of trepidation, but it all went down with flying colors. </p>

<p>This seems like a checkpoint passed, especially for feeling comfortable with an approach over mixed terrain.</p>

        <p>Hiked Sal's Branch at Umstead. This trail is 2.8 mi over moderate/easy terrain like roots, scree, and some small hills.</p>

<p>While it hurt to walk the trail, it wasn't totally debilitating. My ankle somehow didn't swell up, which was good. </p>

<p>This marks the longest walk I've done. Come to think of it, I don't think I've walked more than a half-mile over paved ground up to this point. So, this is a pretty nice victory.</p>

        <p>Looking back on things over the past few months, one positive outcome from being broken up is an increase in both strength and resolve. </p>

<p>Strength came through just showing up and getting to work. Nothing more, nothing less. Each week, I came in at least three times, usually four, sometimes five. I made some noticeable improvements one-day-at-a-time. I'm not a beast for sure, but definitely stronger than when I went in. </p>

<p>The change in my resolve surprised me the most. Supplementary exercises – hangboard, campus board, core – aren't exactly fun compared to actual climbing. But stripped of the ability to climb, those exercises became my new norm. Doing workouts became tolerable, even somewhat fun. Perhaps my expectations got dialed down. </p>

<p>Still though, I'm thankful that I stuck to my guns and kept training. I think this will become a large part of my regimen as I get back onto the wall. And, deep down, I feel like I might emerge as a stronger climber overall. </p>

<p>Time will tell.</p>

        <p>Wow. </p>

<p>After a pretty stressful day, I made a beeline directly to the gym. After a longer-than-usual warmup–most of which was due to being preoccupied and exhausted from work–I set to work. </p>

<p>I cut out all hangboard exercises and favored campusing. I ran through a ton of sets, including some new exercises like 1-3-5 and dynos. Felt good and felt strong. </p>

<p>In addition, I added a footwork circuit on the system wall. I still don't have a great routine down yet, but I think this will be important to rebuilding the foot strength, dexterity, and precision that I've lost. </p>

<p>Most of the routine was doable, but it still hurt a bit to weight my left foot. Doing a dropknee on that foot was out of the question. </p>

<p>Overall, I feel like some of the toe and outer foot pain is subsiding with use. The heel pain is no longer present, and flexion feels good and pain-free. There's still some work to be done on ROM, but we're talking about a few degrees here and there; it's not much to deal with. </p>

<p>Psyched!</p>

        <p>Second day climbing since the accident, first time with two shoes on. Ran up a few sub 5.10 routes at TRC. </p>

<p>During today's session, I vacillated between feeling ready for 10s and 11s … and feeling like I couldn't put more than average weight on the left foot. A few times I caught myself foot-swapping and stepping through to avoid weighting the ankle. </p>

<p>Over time this will dissipate. </p>

<p>After climbing, I set up my counterweight system and easily did a few 1-armed pullups with -35# weight. I need to drop this weight over the coming weeks and get down to zero. </p>

<p>It felt great to get out on the wall again. The hangboard training definitely kept my fitness up and I didn't get pumped at all. Coming home felt like I hadn't even worked out.</p>

<p>Today, I traded my boot for a nice lace-up fabric ankle brace. I can now walk with two real shoes on. </p>

<p>Damn it feels good to be a gangsta.</p>

<p>It still feels sore when I walk, but I expect that'll diminish over the next few weeks. I wouldn't be surprised if I have nagging soreness for a year or so – maybe forever. On one hand, that's a bummer, but on the other I'm stoked to be moving freely again. A few points over the past few months put that into question. </p>

<p>Tonight's my gym night, but I'm going to pass. I'm going to celebrate with a beer.</p>

        <p>Today, I climbed my first routes. </p>

<p>Started with a 5.5, ended with a 5.8+. Never have I felt so stoked to climb that grade. </p>

<p>Climbing in a boot is hard. I wasn't sure how much weight it would bear, so I gingerly weighted it when necessary, but avoided it as much as I could. Luckily, it all felt ok and there were no problems. I think I could handle some ARC workouts, especially once I get the boot off. </p>

<p>After that (and a few ladders), I walked on the treadmill for 0.5 mi. Not a lot, I'll admit, but boredom took over. It's technically the longest I've walked so far, so that's something. It's cool to see that it didn't cause any pain.</p>

        <p>Today, I cut the grass. </p>

<p>Sounds lame, but it's the most significant milestone in my recovery. I took off the boot, laced up some high-top hiking boots, and pushed that lawnmower around the yard. To this point, I hadn't walked more than a few meters without the boot.</p>

<p>It felt good.</p>

<p>Aside from that, training has been going well but it definitely feels like it's stagnating. On some exercises, I think I'm regressing. This could be overtraining or it could be diet-related. I'm thinking it's the latter, possibly combined with mounting boredom. I'm anxious to get on the wall again and stop dicking around with hangboards. </p>

        <p>Today was the first day of Physical Therapy and it went really well. My range of motion and strength were much better than expected and it's possible we'll be able to accelerate the regimen. I left with a few excercises to do each day. </p>

<p>After that, I took a walk around the block. This time, I did 3/4 of it without a crutch. Goddamn it hurt at the end though. For the rest of the night, I was icing my foot on the couch.</p>

<p>At the end of the night, however, I went through my ankle exercises while watching TV. Surprisingly, once I did those, nearly all of the significant pain in my ankle went away. I was able to walk around in the boot more smoothly than before. Perhaps there's something to the exercises. </p>

        <p>It's easy to think that progress isn't happening. </p>

<p>Over the past few days, I've been worried that I'm not moving toward full recovery fast enough or at all. It's easy to focus on the stiffness and the pain, and avoid seeing the small wins that add up to recovery. </p>

<p>So with that in mind, a few recent wins:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Last Wednesday, weighted foot for the first time. </li>
  <li>Last Sunday, walked around the block on one crutch.</li>
  <li>Today, walked up the stairs like a normal person – albeit using the handrail. </li>

        <p>This was a week of firsts. </p>

<p>On Wednesday, I started walking again. On Saturday, I started working the campus ladder. Those are two positive improvements that I'm really happy to see.</p>

<p>Walking is both challenging and not. It's strange. I'm hyperaware that it's hard and that it hurts. The pain isn't fierce or piercing, but dull and arthritic. When I walk, I notice my tendency to counter-compensate away from the pain. I employed the same technique prior to my hip replacement and I'm really cautious not depend on that, lest I breed new (bad) habits.</p>

<p>I hope the pain subsides with activity. I added a new element to my training program: walking around the block. While it's a pretty lame activity, it's absolutely essential. </p>

<p>At the gym yesterday and today, I started working campus ladders. Holy shit, how much fun. I guess I've been on the hangboard so long that I forgot how good it feels to ascend something. In my training plan, I started with matched ladders but soon found those to be too easy. Now, I'm just alternating hands with a set of pullups at the top. </p>

<p>In the back of my mind, I'm worried that my ankle will continue to be arthritic. One hint that things might get better is how my ankle felt after walking and climbing today. When I took the boot off, it was stiff-ish, but rolling it around felt good. I could notice the pain, but it was a <em>good pain</em> – a feeling of tightness and soreness coupled with the desire to flex it hard. I've felt this before on other injuries and it's always been a good sign.</p>

        <p>Just got back from my second post-op checkup, which is also the first time we looked at x-rays. </p>

<p>Progress. The foot seems to be healing and I was okay'ed to start bearing weight on it. For the next three weeks I'll be gradually increasing the weight in the boot and weaning myself off crutches. I'm super excited about this, but I'm trying to temper my enthusiasm. It's possible this won't go that well and I may continue to be arthritic even if all goes according to plan. </p>

        <p>The last few sessions have been getting a bit monotonous and I feel like it's time to start working pull strength again. So today, I changed up my routine and incorporated: </p>

<ul>
  <li>pinch pullups</li>
  <li>offset pullups</li>
  <li>campus rung cycles</li>
</ul>

<p>The cycles were a new invention. I wanted to be able to use the campus board, but I'm still fearful about falling onto my foot. Cycles basically compress the up-down campus workout into the first two rungs. </p>

        <p>I've been into the training program for a few weeks now, hittin the gym about 3-4 times a week. I've been really pleased at how fast I'm advancing through the finger strength exercises. </p>

<p>I always had pretty decent crimp, pinch, and hand strength, but I can tell it's been vastly improved. The little edges that I didn't even sniff at before now seem routine.</p>

<p>I think it's time to start transitioning away from basic deadhangs and start working pull strength and lockoffs.</p>

<p>Still no word yet on the prognosis of my foot. I go in for x-rays next week. Hope it all goes well. </p>

        <p>I just got back from a session at TRC. It went ok, but I definitely noticed that I hadn't been in the gym in a few days. Eh, it's nice to get pumped out a bit.</p>

<p>Surprisingly enough, I got really psyched when I did some lockoffs and pullups on the campus board. I haven't worked on that since my injury and getting back on it added some much needed variety. Same goes for the mini-campus route I threw together.</p>

<p>I need to remember to keep mixing things up so that it doesn't get stale.</p>

<p>Besides that, I got an invite to the next overseas trip. It's happening in October / November. Damn I want to go.   </p>

        <p>I suspect everyone injured gets to a point where they're sick of being broken. When you want to erase the immediate past and return to trying hard with good friends. When you decide that climbing isn't <em>that</em> dangerous.</p>

<p>Right now, that's me. All I want to do is throw myself at an inspiring – shit, even uninspiring – line. I want to be working at my limit, not some bullshit second tier brought on by injury. Fuck that shit.</p>

<p>This is probably a consequence of recovery. When you start feeling capable, strong, and antsy, it's easier to excuse the risks involved. </p>

<p>In his first post-accident post, he mentioned a great quote which is worth remembering.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong in the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.</p>

        <p>So, I've progressed through a good amount of RPTP and while it reads like a sports medicine textbook, I appreciate having access to the detail. I'm left wishing there was a quick boilerplate to customize. Maybe I haven't read that far yet.</p>

<p>Anyway. I had another gym session tonight. It went <em>ok</em> – I felt on the weak side, which I attribute to poor eating. Last night's dinner of egg burritos wasn't very balanced. My breakfast of cereal was lamer than usual and I skipped lunch. I think that contributed to me feeling more lethargic than usual. While all meals need to be improved, I need to figure out a good "in-a-pinch" lunch strategy, if nothing else.</p>

<p>Besides that, I'm aiming to hit at least three sessions per week at a minimum. That seems easily doable, if on the light side. Boredom will probably be the biggest distractor, which I hope will be resolved by spending time between the two TRCs.</p>

        <p>When I started training at Progression a few months back, I went through the process of identifying strengths and weaknesses. Of course, I completely forgot all that. So here's a quick brain dump to start things off again.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Strengths</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong upper body and core.</li>
      <li>Good crimp strength.</li>
      <li>Got a lot better at reading routes this year.</li>
      <li>Good at holding dynamic movement.</li>
      <li>Flexible.</li>
      <li>Good shoulder strength.</li>
      <li>Much better at breathing and pacing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Weaknesses</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced load bearing and coordination of my left ankle / foot</li>
      <li>Rarely–if ever–try outside routes multiple times.</li>
      <li>Often pump out on long hauls.</li>
      <li>On problematic parts, I don't seek out new beta.</li>
      <li>Don't piece routes together.</li>
      <li>Often go into auto-pilot and don't think deeply about what's happening.</li>
      <li>Don't trust feet enough.</li>
      <li>Work grades that are too hard, minimizing time spent getting better.
        <ul>
          <li>Conversely, in sport climbing, I don't try hard enough routes as frequently.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>With these in mind, some activities to remember include:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Try the same route with intentionally different beta.</li>
      <li>Climb routes repeatedly to perfection.</li>
      <li>Focus on optimizing time on the wall.</li>
      <li>Train power endurance more intentionally.</li>
      <li>Break down problems and work moves independently.</li>
      <li>Climb more slab.</li>
      <li>Keep track of my climbing pyramid.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

        <p>The first activity in the RPTP is to establish a goal.</p>

<p>Had I not injured myself – and consequently been more certain about my climbing abilities – I might have chosen a more audacious and compelling goal. But for now, I'm going to be realistic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By December 2014, I want to top-rope a 5.11 in TRC Morrisville's new tall extension.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That gives me about four months from the point at which I can begin weight-bearing. It seems like such a silly goal right now, but at the same time, so unreachable.</p>

<p>Intermediate goals I need to hit in order to achieve this are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find a dedicated partner / partners by mid-September.</li>
  <li>Be able to walk unaided by September.</li>
  <li>Be able to weight my left foot entirely by October.</li>
  <li>Be able to start climbing walls by mid-September.</li>
  <li>Be able to climb 5.7 - 5.11 on the shorter walls.</li>

<p>Assuming things go well and I'm able to climb again, my multi-year goal is to climb Apollo Reed (13a) at Summersville.</p>

<p>In other news, I pulled off my adhesives that held together my incision after surgery. I collect scars like others collect tattoos.</p>

<p>I also received my copy (cough textbook) of The Rockclimber's Training Manual. I spent a little time poring over this tonight with a glass of wine. My kind of training. Hey, today's a rest day after all.</p>

        <p>My copy of RCTM / RPTP is in the mail, but I can't wait. To get a head start, I'm acquainting myself with some of the concepts that Mark outlines on his blog. Here are my notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Periodization</strong> - Scheduling different phases of training to reach a performance peak at a predetermined time.
    <ul>
      <li>The RPTP is three-to-four months long, which leads to three-to-four cycles per year.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Phases:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Training
        <ul>
          <li>Base</li>
          <li>Strength</li>
          <li>Power</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Performance
        <ul>
          <li>Power-Endurance</li>
          <li>Sending</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Rest</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Phase Length</strong> - between two-to-five weeks, with most in the three-to-four week range.
    <ul>
      <li>Should vary on the climber's training experience, the needs of the phase, and the climber's goals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Transition Phase</strong> - one-to-two week gradient between power / performance phases.</li>
  <li><strong>Whole Body Strength Training</strong> - supplemental exercises during strength phase. Types: pulling, shoulders, upper arm, core.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal Setting</strong> is an important precursor that helps shape your training program by identifying specific challenges to address.
    <ul>
      <li>Should be very discrete and clear. "Send Apollo Reed" rather than "Send 5.13"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Training Efficiency</strong> - it's important to maximize improvement relative to training time.
    <ul>
      <li>Repeated low efficiency activities increase recovery time, sapping energy from high efficiency activities. This can result in the climber struggling to maintain fitness.</li>
      <li>RPTP favors high intensity training and minimal cross-training.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Power Training</strong> - designed to increase the amount of force that can be applied in a short period of time.
    <ul>
      <li>Increases fiber-contraction speed.</li>
      <li>Increases intramuscular coordination and spatial awareness.</li>
      <li>Two fundamental exercises: limit bouldering and campusing.</li>
      <li>Number of repetitions is small but intensity is high.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Later today I hit up TRC for a bit more hangboarding. </p>

<p>I always feel more centered after listening to Fred Nicole speak about climbing. For someone who influenced the sport as much as he did, he's incredibly humble and aware of what matters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sport aspect is great, but I think it's very creative too. It's a bit more than a physical activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, I went back to the gym and did a hangboard session. I started to add more structure to it, mostly in anticipation of weaving the Rock Prodigy program into my training.</p>

<p>I noticed a small twinge in my right ring finger – a sure sign that I need to be careful, lest I pop a pulley.</p>

        <p>Oh man! I thawed my membership at <a href="http://trianglerockclub.com">TRC</a> and went in for a solid hangboard session. It's amazing how much more fun and motivating it is to train in a gym compared to at home. The environment just seems more conducive to trying hard and staying psyched.</p>

<p>I went through an ad hoc series of drills, mostly focused around pyramids on the Beastmaker 1000 and a Moonboard. Like earlier workouts, I threw in some walking lockoffs and frenchies for fun. While playing around today, I realized I can lock off on either arm. I'm not quite at 90º, but I'm not that far off. Doing this made me remember my first human flag, which I did at <a href="http://climbprogression.com">Progression</a> the week before all this started.</p>

<p>This visit today reinvigorated me. I feel like I will be able to get strong while I recuperate. I can't wait for my <a href="http://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/">training manual</a> to get here!</p>

        <p>Not gonna lie, I'm pretty stoked at today's news.</p>

<p>I went in for my first checkup and they moved me out of the hard cast. Now I'm in a small boot, which I can take off for a good scratch now and then. I'm also able – actually encouraged – to move it around.</p>

<p>This is great to hear. It sounds like I may be weight bearing sooner than I think. More importantly, I can train on it and not worry about funking the cast up with sweat. :)</p>

<p>Aaand here’s Ronnie Dickinson climbing Dragon Turns (V9) at The Gunks with a prosthetic leg. No excuses.</p>

<p>I did my core routine again, leveling up a few exercises and adding rock rings to the mix. I'm feeling pretty tired but happy to get the blood flowing. I quickly realized that basic hangs are orders of magnitude more fun than pull-ups or ab work.</p>

        <p>After working from home since Monday, I made my first trip back into the office.</p>

<p>I just got finished reading <a href="http://climbing.ilooove.it/story/the-fall">this story</a> about someone who took a nasty fall on trad –  ultimately breaking his back. His conclusion sounds like so many others: while he now has a deeper appreciation for the risk, ultimately he’s going to keep climbing.</p>

<p>I don’t disagree with that mentality. I feel the same way most days.</p>

<p>But I really wonder if it’s worth it sometimes. I probably won’t be able to walk properly when I’m older. It’s possible I’ll need an ankle fusion in the near term. If I were to keep climbing, who knows what could happen if I took a bad fall on this foot again? It’s hard to stop doing what you enjoy when it’s unclear whether the risk is acceptable or not.</p>

<p><a href="http://climbing.ilooove.it/story/climbing-my-way-back-up">This story</a> also resonated with me. This woman persevered through a much harder situation than mine.</p>

        <p>Watching this video of Kev Shields, a climber who busted his ankle up bad and had an ankle fusion. Took him 5 years to get back to climbing E7 (.13a - .13c).</p>

<p>I totally understand his drive to want to get back to his pre-injury level.</p>

        <p>I started back at work today, albeit from the comfort of my couch. I could have started last week with no issues, but I figured taking a staycation would be good for my soul.</p>

<p>I had a beer with some folks from the climbing gym. They talked a lot about problems they were working on, miming the beta that they had worked out.</p>

<p>It bummed me out to hear that – only because I wanted to jump on those routes and do them. I started thinking that, even if I come back, I might only be capable of really simple jug hauls. That doesn't seem like a whole lot of fun.</p>

<p>Climbing became a big part of who I am and it’s something I really enjoy. To think that I might not ever be able to climb again (especially at hard grades) really disappoints me.</p>

        <p>It's kind of hard to call it training at all, but at least I'm getting some exercise.
I focused mostly on core exercises with a few pull-ups thrown in. Surprisingly (or maybe not), my core felt good. I need to up the ante some. My arms, however, are feeling weaker than usual.</p>

<p>I’m concerned that this might have some negative effects on the healing process, so I’m going to take it easy until I can talk to the doc. I can’t imagine that increased blood flow throughout the body wouldn’t be a good thing though.</p>

<p>Aside from this, I’ve been using <a href="http://lift.do">Lift.do</a> to keep track of my eating schedule. So far, I’ve been diligent about eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner for a few days straight. For me, that’s unheard of.</p>

<p>Unrelated, WTF is up with my skin? It's super dry and flaking off. So much for the callouses. I'm not sure if this is due to painkillers or what; it's not my soap, I don't think.</p>

The foot soreness is way down, almost non-existent. How is that possible?</p>

<p>I've been reading up on <a href="http://adventuresportsjournal.com/biking/legends#lynnHill">Lynn Hill</a> and <a href="http://cragmama.com/2012/02/tales-of-a-broken-talus-update-1/">Cragmama’s</a> injuries. Maybe it’s not so crazy that I can climb again?</p>

<p>I also read some posts that recommended laying off caffeine, as it’s a vasoconstrictor. It might not be an issue, but it probably wouldn't hurt to decrease my coffee intake a bit. My big concern is developing avascular necrosis.</p>

<p>This is my first day post-surgery. Damn this hurts like hell.  I only slept a few hours last night, even with a butt load of pain killers.</p>

<p>I'm disappointed that my climbing days are probably over. They might need to fuse the whole the whole thing together if it doesn't heal properly.</p>

        <p>My copy of RCTM / RPTP is in the mail, but I can't wait. To get a head start, I'm acquainting myself with some of the concepts Mark outlines on his blog. Here's my notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Periodization</strong> - Scheduling different phases of training to reach a performance peak at a predetermined time.
    <ul>
      <li>The RPTP is three-to-four months long, which leads to three-to-four cycles per year.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Phases:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Training
        <ul>
          <li>Base</li>
          <li>Strength</li>
          <li>Power</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Performance
        <ul>
          <li>Power-Endurance</li>
          <li>Sending</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Rest</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Phase Length</strong> - between two-to-five weeks, with most in the three-to-four week range.
    <ul>
      <li>Should vary on the climber's training experience, the needs of the phase, and the climber's goals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Transition Phase</strong> - one-to-two week gradient between power / performance phases.</li>
  <li><strong>Whole Body Strength Training</strong> - supplemental exercises during strength phase. Types: pulling, shoulders, upper arm, core.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal Setting</strong> is an important precursor that helps shape your training program by identifying specific challenges to address.
    <ul>
      <li>Should be very discrete and clear. "Send Apollo Reed" rather than "Send 5.13"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Training Efficiency</strong> - it's important to maximize improvement relative to training time.
    <ul>
      <li>Repeated low efficiency activities increase recovery time, sapping energy from high efficiency activities. This can result in the climber struggling to maintain fitness.</li>
      <li>RPTP favors high intensity training and minimal cross-training.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Power Training</strong> - designed to increase the amount of force that can be applied in a short period of time.
    <ul>
      <li>Increases fiber-contraction speed.</li>
      <li>Increases intramuscular coordination and spatial awareness.</li>
      <li>Two fundamental exercises: limit bouldering and campusing.</li>
      <li>Number of repetitions is small but intensity is high.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I always feel more centered after listening to Fred Nicole speak about climbing. For someone who influenced the sport as much as he did, he's incredibly humble and aware of what matters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sport aspect is great, but I think it's very creative too. It's a bit more than a physical activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, I went back to the gym and did a hangboard session. I started to add more structure to it, mostly in anticipation of weaving the Rock Prodigy program into my training.</p>

<p>I noticed a small twinge in my right ring finger – a sure sign that I need to be careful, lest I pop a pulley.</p>

        <p>Oh man! I thawed my membership at <a href="http://trianglerockclub.com">TRC</a> and went in for a solid hangboard session. It's amazing how much more fun and motivating it is to train in a gym compared to at home. The environment just seems more conducive to trying hard and staying psyched.</p>

<p>I went through an ad hoc series of drills, mostly focused around pyramids on the Beastmaker 1000 and a Moonboard. Like earlier workouts, I threw in some walking lockoffs and frenchies for fun. While playing around today, I realized I can lock off on either arm. I'm not quite at 90º, but I'm not that far off. Doing this made me remember my first human flag, which I did at <a href="http://climbprogression.com">Progression</a> the week before all this started.</p>

<p>This visit today reinvigorated me. I feel like I will be able to get strong while I recuperate. I can't wait for my <a href="http://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/">training manual</a> to get here!</p>

        <p>Not gonna lie, I'm pretty stoked at today's news.</p>

<p>I went in for my first checkup and they moved me out of the hard cast. Now I'm in a small boot, which I can take off for a good scratch now and then. I'm also able – actually encouraged – to move it around.</p>

<p>This is great to hear. It sounds like I may be weight bearing sooner than I think. More importantly, I can train on it and not worry about funking the cast up with sweat. :)</p>

<p>Aaand here’s Ronnie Dickinson climbing Dragon Turns (V9) at The Gunks with a prosthetic leg. No excuses.</p>

<p>I did my core routine again, leveling up a few exercises and adding rock rings to the mix. I'm feeling pretty tired but happy to get the blood flowing. I quickly realized that basic hangs are orders of magnitude more fun than pull-ups or ab work.</p>

        <p>After working from home since Monday, I made my first trip back into the office.</p>

<p>I just got finished reading <a href="http://climbing.ilooove.it/story/the-fall">this story</a> about someone who took a nasty fall on trad –  ultimately breaking his back. His conclusion sounds like so many others: while he now has a deeper appreciation for the risk, ultimately he’s going to keep climbing.</p>

<p>I don’t disagree with that mentality. I feel the same way most days.</p>

<p>But I really wonder if it’s worth it sometimes. I probably won’t be able to walk properly when I’m older. It’s possible I’ll need an ankle fusion in the near term. If I were to keep climbing, who knows what could happen if I took a bad fall on this foot again? It’s hard to stop doing what you enjoy when it’s unclear whether the risk is acceptable or not.</p>

<p><a href="http://climbing.ilooove.it/story/climbing-my-way-back-up">This story</a> also resonated with me. This woman persevered through a much harder situation than mine.</p>

        <p>Watching this video of Kev Shields, a climber who busted his ankle up bad and had an ankle fusion. Took him 5 years to get back to climbing E7 (.13a - .13c).</p>

<p>I totally understand his drive to want to get back to his pre-injury level.</p>

        <p>I started back at work today, albeit from the comfort of my couch. I could have started last week with no issues, but I figured taking a staycation would be good for my soul.</p>

<p>I had a beer with some folks from the climbing gym. They talked a lot about problems they were working on, miming the beta that they had worked out.</p>

<p>It bummed me out to hear that – only because I wanted to jump on those routes and do them. I started thinking that, even if I come back, I might only be capable of really simple jug hauls. That doesn't seem like a whole lot of fun.</p>

<p>Climbing became a big part of who I am and it’s something I really enjoy. To think that I might not ever be able to climb again (especially at hard grades) really disappoints me.</p>

        <p>It's kind of hard to call it training at all, but at least I'm getting some exercise.
I focused mostly on core exercises with a few pull-ups thrown in. Surprisingly (or maybe not), my core felt good. I need to up the ante some. My arms, however, are feeling weaker than usual.</p>

<p>I’m concerned that this might have some negative effects on the healing process, so I’m going to take it easy until I can talk to the doc. I can’t imagine that increased blood flow throughout the body wouldn’t be a good thing though.</p>

<p>Aside from this, I’ve been using <a href="http://lift.do">Lift.do</a> to keep track of my eating schedule. So far, I’ve been diligent about eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner for a few days straight. For me, that’s unheard of.</p>

<p>Unrelated, WTF is up with my skin? It's super dry and flaking off. So much for the callouses. I'm not sure if this is due to painkillers or what; it's not my soap, I don't think.</p>

        <p>Feeling way better today; I actually slept well last night. Got up and made Wendy and I some breakfast.
The foot soreness is way down, almost non-existent. How is that possible?</p>

<p>I've been reading up on <a href="http://adventuresportsjournal.com/biking/legends#lynnHill">Lynn Hill</a> and <a href="http://cragmama.com/2012/02/tales-of-a-broken-talus-update-1/">Cragmama’s</a> injuries. Maybe it’s not so crazy that I can climb again?</p>

<p>I also read some posts that recommended laying off caffeine, as it’s a vasoconstrictor. It might not be an issue, but it probably wouldn't hurt to decrease my coffee intake a bit. My big concern is developing avascular necrosis.</p>

<p>This is my first day post-surgery. Damn this hurts like hell.  I only slept a few hours last night, even with a butt load of pain killers.</p>

<p>I'm disappointed that my climbing days are probably over. They might need to fuse the whole the whole thing together if it doesn't heal properly.</p>

<p>Falling on this again seems out of the question.</p>

        <p>Sometime around 3:00pm today, I had surgery at Duke. They told me – actually, told my sister – that there were a lot of little bits to deal with. Some they were able to clean out. Two pieces could be held together with a dissolvable screw. The other ones they <strong>packed in there.</strong></p>

<p>Really, not exactly what I wanted to hear.</p>

        <p>Had it looked at today by foot and ankle doctor at Duke. It sounds fucked. I broke the talus into a lot of little pieces and they want to operate immediately.</p>

        <p>Duke Ortho looked at this and think the x-rays might not tell the whole story. There's some fragmentation for sure, but it's not clear whether some of the detail they're seeing is new or pre-existing. They're referring me to the Foot &amp; Ankle practice for further review. I'll need to get some CT scans done beforehand.</p>

        <p>Went off route, got pumped, and took a pendulum swing into the wall. I'm at Duke Urgent Care now getting it appraised. It looks to be a bad sprain / minor break. Overall it's not <em>that</em> painful, but it definitely won't bear weight.</p>

      <div class="post__body">
        <p>Oh man! I thawed my membership at <a href="http://trianglerockclub.com">TRC</a> and went in for a solid hangboard session. It's amazing how much more fun and motivating it is to train in a gym compared to at home. The environment just seems more conducive to trying hard and staying psyched.</p>

<p>I went through an ad hoc series of drills, mostly focused around pyramids on the Beastmaker 1000 and a Moonboard. Like earlier workouts, I threw in some walking lockoffs and frenchies for fun. While playing around today, I realized I can lock off on either arm. I'm not quite at 90º, but I'm not that far off. Doing this made me remember my first human flag, which I did at <a href="http://climbprogression.com">Progression</a> the week before all this started. </p>

<p>This visit today reinvigorated me. I feel like I will be able to get strong while I recuperate. I can't wait for my <a href="http://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/">training manual</a> to get here!</p>

        <p>Not gonna lie, I'm pretty stoked at today's news.</p>

<p>I went in for my first checkup and they moved me out of the hard cast. Now I'm in a small boot, which I can take off for a good scratch now and then. I'm also able – actually encouraged – to move it around.</p>

<p>This is great to hear. It sounds like I may be weight bearing sooner than I think. More importantly, I can train on it and not worry about funking the cast up with sweat. :)</p>

<p>Aaand here’s Ronnie Dickinson climbing Dragon Turns (V9) at The Gunks with a prosthetic leg. No excuses.</p>

<p>I did my core routine again, leveling up a few exercises and adding rock rings to the mix. I'm feeling pretty tired but happy to get the blood flowing. I quickly realized that basic hangs are orders of magnitude more fun than pull-ups or ab work.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="post__body">
        <p>After working from home since Monday, I made my first trip back into the office.</p>

<p>I just got finished reading <a href="http://climbing.ilooove.it/story/the-fall">this story</a> about someone who took a nasty fall on trad –  ultimately breaking his back. His conclusion sounds like so many others: while he now has a deeper appreciation for the risk, ultimately he’s going to keep climbing.</p>

<p>I don’t disagree with that mentality. I feel the same way most days.</p>

<p>But I really wonder if it’s worth it sometimes. I probably won’t be able to walk properly when I’m older. It’s possible I’ll need an ankle fusion in the near term. If I were to keep climbing, who knows what could happen if I took a bad fall on this foot again? It’s hard to stop doing what you enjoy when it’s unclear whether the risk is acceptable or not.</p>

<p><a href="http://climbing.ilooove.it/story/climbing-my-way-back-up">This story</a> also resonated with me. This woman persevered through a much harder situation than mine. </p>

        <p>Watching this video of Kev Shields, a climber who busted his ankle up bad and had an ankle fusion. Took him 5 years to get back to climbing E7 (.13a - .13c).</p>

<p>I totally understand his drive to want to get back to his pre-injury level.</p>

      <div class="post__body">
        <p>I started back at work today, albeit from the comfort of my couch. I could have started last week with no issues, but I figured taking a staycation would be good for my soul.</p>

<p>I had a beer with some folks from the climbing gym. They talked a lot about problems they were working on, miming the beta that they had worked out.</p>

<p>It bummed me out to hear that – only because I wanted to jump on those routes and do them. I started thinking that, even if I come back, I might only be capable of really simple jug hauls. That doesn't seem like a whole lot of fun.</p>

<p>Climbing became a big part of who I am and it’s something I really enjoy. To think that I might not ever be able to climb again (especially at hard grades) really disappoints me.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="post__body">
        <p>It's kind of hard to call it training at all, but at least I'm getting some exercise.
I focused mostly on core exercises with a few pull-ups thrown in. Surprisingly (or maybe not), my core felt good. I need to up the ante some. My arms, however, are feeling weaker than usual.</p>

<p>I’m concerned that this might have some negative effects on the healing process, so I’m going to take it easy until I can talk to the doc. I can’t imagine that increased blood flow throughout the body wouldn’t be a good thing though.</p>

<p>Aside from this, I’ve been using <a href="http://lift.do">Lift.do</a> to keep track of my eating schedule. So far, I’ve been diligent about eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner for a few days straight. For me, that’s unheard of.</p>

<p>Unrelated, WTF is up with my skin? It's super dry and flaking off. So much for the callouses. I'm not sure if this is due to painkillers or what; it's not my soap, I don't think.</p>

        <p>More of the same. I'm getting bored but liking the vacation. There's no foot pain to speak of, so I'm going to ramp down the pain killers.</p>

        <p>Feeling way better today; I actually slept well last night. Got up and made Wendy and I some breakfast.
The foot soreness is way down, almost non-existent. How is that possible?</p>

<p>I've been reading up on <a href="http://adventuresportsjournal.com/biking/legends#lynnHill">Lynn Hill</a> and <a href="http://cragmama.com/2012/02/tales-of-a-broken-talus-update-1/">Cragmama’s</a> injuries. Maybe it’s not so crazy that I can climb again?</p>

<p>I also read some posts that recommended laying off caffeine, as it’s a vasoconstrictor. It might not be an issue, but it probably wouldn't hurt to decrease my coffee intake a bit. My big concern is developing avascular necrosis.</p>

<p>This is my first day post-surgery. Damn this hurts like hell.  I only slept a few hours last night, even with a butt load of pain killers.</p>

<p>I'm disappointed that my climbing days are probably over. They might need to fuse the whole the whole thing together if it doesn't heal properly.</p>

<p>Falling on this again seems out of the question.</p>

        <p>Sometime around 3:00pm today, I had surgery at Duke. They told me – actually, told my sister – that there were a lot of little bits to deal with. Some they were able to clean out. Two pieces could be held together with a dissolvable screw. The other ones they <strong>packed in there.</strong></p>

<p>Really, not exactly what I wanted to hear.</p>

There's some fragmentation for sure, but it's not clear whether some of the detail they're seeing is new or pre-existing. They're referring me to the Foot &amp; Ankle practice for further review. I'll need to get some CT scans done beforehand.</p>

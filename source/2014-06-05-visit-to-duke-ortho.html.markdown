Duke Ortho looked at this and think the x-rays might not tell the whole story. There's some fragmentation for sure, but it's not clear whether some of the detail they're seeing is new or pre-existing. They're referring me to the Foot & Ankle practice for further review. I'll need to get some CT scans done beforehand.

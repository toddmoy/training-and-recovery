Sometime around 3:00pm today, I had surgery at Duke. They told me -- actually, told my sister -- that there were a lot of little bits to deal with. Some they were able to clean out. Two pieces could be held together with a dissolvable screw. The other ones they **packed in there.**

Really, not exactly what I wanted to hear.

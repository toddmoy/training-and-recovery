This is my first day post-surgery. Damn this hurts like hell.  I only slept a few hours last night, even with a butt load of pain killers.

I'm disappointed that my climbing days are probably over. They might need to fuse the whole the whole thing together if it doesn't heal properly.

Falling on this again seems out of the question.

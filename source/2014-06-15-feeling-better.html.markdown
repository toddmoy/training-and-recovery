Feeling way better today; I actually slept well last night. Got up and made Wendy and I some breakfast.
The foot soreness is way down, almost non-existent. How is that possible?

I've been reading up on [Lynn Hill](http://adventuresportsjournal.com/biking/legends#lynnHill) and [Cragmama’s](http://cragmama.com/2012/02/tales-of-a-broken-talus-update-1/) injuries. Maybe it’s not so crazy that I can climb again?

I also read some posts that recommended laying off caffeine, as it’s a vasoconstrictor. It might not be an issue, but it probably wouldn't hurt to decrease my coffee intake a bit. My big concern is developing avascular necrosis.

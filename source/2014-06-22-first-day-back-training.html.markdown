It's kind of hard to call it training at all, but at least I'm getting some exercise.
I focused mostly on core exercises with a few pull-ups thrown in. Surprisingly (or maybe not), my core felt good. I need to up the ante some. My arms, however, are feeling weaker than usual.

I’m concerned that this might have some negative effects on the healing process, so I’m going to take it easy until I can talk to the doc. I can’t imagine that increased blood flow throughout the body wouldn’t be a good thing though.

Aside from this, I’ve been using [Lift.do](http://lift.do) to keep track of my eating schedule. So far, I’ve been diligent about eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner for a few days straight. For me, that’s unheard of.

Unrelated, WTF is up with my skin? It's super dry and flaking off. So much for the callouses. I'm not sure if this is due to painkillers or what; it's not my soap, I don't think.

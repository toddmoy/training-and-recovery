After working from home since Monday, I made my first trip back into the office.

I just got finished reading [this story](http://climbing.ilooove.it/story/the-fall) about someone who took a nasty fall on trad --  ultimately breaking his back. His conclusion sounds like so many others: while he now has a deeper appreciation for the risk, ultimately he’s going to keep climbing.

I don’t disagree with that mentality. I feel the same way most days.

But I really wonder if it’s worth it sometimes. I probably won’t be able to walk properly when I’m older. It’s possible I’ll need an ankle fusion in the near term. If I were to keep climbing, who knows what could happen if I took a bad fall on this foot again? It’s hard to stop doing what you enjoy when it’s unclear whether the risk is acceptable or not.

[This story](http://climbing.ilooove.it/story/climbing-my-way-back-up) also resonated with me. This woman persevered through a much harder situation than mine.

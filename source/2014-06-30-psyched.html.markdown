Not gonna lie, I'm pretty stoked at today's news.

I went in for my first checkup and they moved me out of the hard cast. Now I'm in a small boot, which I can take off for a good scratch now and then. I'm also able – actually encouraged – to move it around.

This is great to hear. It sounds like I may be weight bearing sooner than I think. More importantly, I can train on it and not worry about funking the cast up with sweat. :)

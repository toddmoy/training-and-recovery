Oh man! I thawed my membership at [TRC](http://trianglerockclub.com) and went in for a solid hangboard session. It's amazing how much more fun and motivating it is to train in a gym compared to at home. The environment just seems more conducive to trying hard and staying psyched.

I went through an ad hoc series of drills, mostly focused around pyramids on the Beastmaker 1000 and a Moonboard. Like earlier workouts, I threw in some walking lockoffs and frenchies for fun. While playing around today, I realized I can lock off on either arm. I'm not quite at 90ยบ, but I'm not that far off. Doing this made me remember my first human flag, which I did at [Progression](http://climbprogression.com) the week before all this started.

This visit today reinvigorated me. I feel like I will be able to get strong while I recuperate. I can't wait for my [training manual](http://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/) to get here!

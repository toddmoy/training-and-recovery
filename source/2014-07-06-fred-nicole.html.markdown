I always feel more centered after listening to Fred Nicole speak about climbing. For someone who influenced the sport as much as he did, he's incredibly humble and aware of what matters.

> The sport aspect is great, but I think it's very creative too. It's a bit more than a physical activity.

Today, I went back to the gym and did a hangboard session. I started to add more structure to it, mostly in anticipation of weaving the Rock Prodigy program into my training.

I noticed a small twinge in my right ring finger -- a sure sign that I need to be careful, lest I pop a pulley.

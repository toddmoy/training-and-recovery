My copy of RCTM / RPTP is in the mail, but I can't wait. To get a head start, I'm acquainting myself with some of the concepts Mark outlines on his blog. Here's my notes:

* **Periodization** - Scheduling different phases of training to reach a performance peak at a predetermined time.
  * The RPTP is three-to-four months long, which leads to three-to-four cycles per year.
* **Phases:**
  * Training
    * Base
    * Strength
    * Power
  * Performance
    * Power-Endurance
    * Sending
  * Rest
* **Phase Length** - between two-to-five weeks, with most in the three-to-four week range.
  * Should vary on the climber's training experience, the needs of the phase, and the climber's goals.
* **Transition Phase** - one-to-two week gradient between power / performance phases.
* **Whole Body Strength Training** - supplemental exercises during strength phase. Types: pulling, shoulders, upper arm, core.
* **Goal Setting** is an important precursor that helps shape your training program by identifying specific challenges to address.
  * Should be very discrete and clear. "Send Apollo Reed" rather than "Send 5.13"
* **Training Efficiency** - it's important to maximize improvement relative to training time.
  * Repeated low efficiency activities increase recovery time, sapping energy from high efficiency activities. This can result in the climber struggling to maintain fitness.
  * RPTP favors high intensity training and minimal cross-training.
* **Power Training** - designed to increase the amount of force that can be applied in a short period of time.
  * Increases fiber-contraction speed.
  * Increases intramuscular coordination and spatial awareness.
  * Two fundamental exercises: limit bouldering and campusing.
  * Number of repetitions is small but intensity is high.

Came across this video of Courtney Sanders who was training while injured.

In other news, I pulled off my adhesives that held together my incision after surgery. I collect scars like others collect tattoos.

I also received my copy (cough textbook) of The Rockclimber's Training Manual. I spent a little time poring over this tonight with a glass of wine. My kind of training. Hey, today's a rest day after all.

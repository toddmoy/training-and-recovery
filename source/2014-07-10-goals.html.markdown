The first activity in the RPTP is to establish a goal.

Had I not injured myself -- and consequently been more certain about my climbing abilities -- I might have chosen a more audacious and compelling goal. But for now, I'm going to be realistic.

> By December 2014, I want to top-rope a 5.11 in TRC Morrisville's new tall extension.

That gives me about four months from the point at which I can begin weight-bearing. It seems like such a silly goal right now, but at the same time, so unreachable.

Intermediate goals I need to hit in order to achieve this are:

1. Find a dedicated partner / partners by mid-September.
1. Be able to walk unaided by September.
1. Be able to weight my left foot entirely by October.
1. Be able to start climbing walls by mid-September.
1. Be able to climb 5.7 - 5.11 on the shorter walls.

Assuming things go well and I'm able to climb again, my multi-year goal is to climb Apollo Reed (13a) at Summersville.

When I started training at Progression a few months back, I went through the process of identifying strengths and weaknesses. Of course, I completely forgot all that. So here's a quick brain dump to start things off again.

* **Strengths**
  * Strong upper body and core.
  * Good crimp strength.
  * Got a lot better at reading routes this year.
  * Good at holding dynamic movement.
  * Flexible.
  * Good shoulder strength.
  * Much better at breathing and pacing.

* **Weaknesses**
  * Reduced load bearing and coordination of my left ankle / foot
  * Rarely--if ever--try outside routes multiple times.
  * Often pump out on long hauls.
  * On problematic parts, I don't seek out new beta.
  * Don't piece routes together.
  * Often go into auto-pilot and don't think deeply about what's happening.
  * Don't trust feet enough.
  * Work grades that are too hard, minimizing time spent getting better.
    * Conversely, in sport climbing, I don't try hard enough routes as frequently.

  With these in mind, some activities to remember include:

  1. Try the same route with intentionally different beta.
  1. Climb routes repeatedly to perfection.
  1. Focus on optimizing time on the wall.
  1. Train power endurance more intentionally.
  1. Break down problems and work moves independently.
  1. Climb more slab.
  1. Keep track of my climbing pyramid.

When I started training at Progression a few months back, I went through the process of identifying strengths and weaknesses. Of course, I completely forgot all that. So here's a quick brain dump to start things off again.

* **Strengths**
  * Strong upper body and core.
  * Good crimp strength.
  * Got a lot better at reading routes this year.
  * Good at holding dynamic movement.
  * Flexible.
  * Good shoulder strength.
  * Much better at breathing and pacing.

* **Weaknesses**
  * Reduced load bearing and coordination of my left ankle / foot
  * Rarely--if ever--try outside routes multiple times.
  * Often pump out on long hauls.
  * On problematic parts, I don't seek out new beta.
  * Don't piece routes together.
  * Often go into auto-pilot and don't think deeply about what's happening.
  * Don't trust feet enough.

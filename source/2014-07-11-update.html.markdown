So, I've progressed through a good amount of RPTP and while it reads like a sports medicine textbook, I appreciate having access to the detail. I'm left wishing there was a quick boilerplate to customize. Maybe I haven't read that far yet.

Anyway. I had another gym session tonight. It went *ok* -- I felt on the weak side, which I attribute to poor eating. Last night's dinner of egg burritos wasn't very balanced. My breakfast of cereal was lamer than usual and I skipped lunch. I think that contributed to me feeling more lethargic than usual. While all meals need to be improved, I need to figure out a good "in-a-pinch" lunch strategy, if nothing else.

Besides that, I'm aiming to hit at least three sessions per week at a minimum. That seems easily doable, if on the light side. Boredom will probably be the biggest distractor, which I hope will be resolved by spending time between the two TRCs.

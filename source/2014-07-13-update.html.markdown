Not much new to report. Still working through hang boarding and such. I've kind of addicted to seeking out stories of other people's recoveries. The latest one I found was from [Kelly](http://kellycordes.wordpress.com/2010/03/09/accident-story/), who by all accounts fucked himself up more royally than me.

In his first post-accident post, he mentioned a great quote which is worth remembering.

> The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong in the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.

_--Ernest Hemingway, The Old Man and the Sea_

I suspect everyone injured gets to a point where they're sick of being broken. When you want to erase the immediate past and return to trying hard with good friends. When you decide that climbing isn't _that_ dangerous.

Right now, that's me. All I want to do is throw myself at an inspiring -- shit, even uninspiring -- line. I want to be working at my limit, not some bullshit second tier brought on by injury. Fuck that shit.

This is probably a consequence of recovery. When you start feeling capable, strong, and antsy, it's easier to excuse the risks involved.

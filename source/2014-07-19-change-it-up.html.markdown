I just got back from a session at TRC. It went ok, but I definitely noticed that I hadn't been in the gym in a few days. Eh, it's nice to get pumped out a bit.

Surprisingly enough, I got really psyched when I did some lockoffs and pullups on the campus board. I haven't worked on that since my injury and getting back on it added some much needed variety. Same goes for the mini-campus route I threw together.

I need to remember to keep mixing things up so that it doesn't get stale.

Besides that, I got an invite to the next overseas trip. It's happening in October / November. Damn I want to go.

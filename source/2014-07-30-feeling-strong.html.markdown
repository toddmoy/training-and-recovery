I've been into the training program for a few weeks now, hittin the gym about 3-4 times a week. I've been really pleased at how fast I'm advancing through the finger strength exercises. 

I always had pretty decent crimp, pinch, and hand strength, but I can tell it's been vastly improved. The little edges that I didn't even sniff at before now seem routine.

I think it's time to start transitioning away from basic deadhangs and start working pull strength and lockoffs.

Still no word yet on the prognosis of my foot. I go in for x-rays next week. Hope it all goes well.

The last few sessions have been getting a bit monotonous and I feel like it's time to start working pull strength again. So today, I changed up my routine and incorporated: 

* pinch pullups
* offset pullups
* campus rung cycles

The cycles were a new invention. I wanted to be able to use the campus board, but I'm still fearful about falling onto my foot. Cycles basically compress the up-down campus workout into the first two rungs.

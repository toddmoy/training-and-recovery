Just got back from my second post-op checkup, which is also the first time we looked at x-rays. 

Progress. The foot seems to be healing and I was okay'ed to start bearing weight on it. For the next three weeks I'll be gradually increasing the weight in the boot and weaning myself off crutches. I'm super excited about this, but I'm trying to temper my enthusiasm. It's possible this won't go that well and I may continue to be arthritic even if all goes according to plan.

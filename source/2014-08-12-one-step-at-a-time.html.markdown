It's easy to think that progress isn't happening. 

Over the past few days, I've been worried that I'm not moving toward full recovery fast enough or at all. It's easy to focus on the stiffness and the pain, and avoid seeing the small wins that add up to recovery. 

So with that in mind, a few recent wins:

* Last Wednesday, weighted foot for the first time. 
* Last Sunday, walked around the block on one crutch.
* Today, walked up the stairs like a normal person -- albeit using the handrail.

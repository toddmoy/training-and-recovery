Today was the first day of Physical Therapy and it went really well. My range of motion and strength were much better than expected and it's possible we'll be able to accelerate the regimen. I left with a few excercises to do each day. 

After that, I took a walk around the block. This time, I did 3/4 of it without a crutch. Goddamn it hurt at the end though. For the rest of the night, I was icing my foot on the couch.

At the end of the night, however, I went through my ankle exercises while watching TV. Surprisingly, once I did those, nearly all of the significant pain in my ankle went away. I was able to walk around in the boot more smoothly than before. Perhaps there's something to the exercises.

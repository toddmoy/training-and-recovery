Today, I cut the grass. 

Sounds lame, but it's the most significant milestone in my recovery. I took off the boot, laced up some high-top hiking boots, and pushed that lawnmower around the yard. To this point, I hadn't walked more than a few meters without the boot.

It felt good.

Aside from that, training has been going well but it definitely feels like it's stagnating. On some exercises, I think I'm regressing. This could be overtraining or it could be diet-related. I'm thinking it's the latter, possibly combined with mounting boredom. I'm anxious to get on the wall again and stop dicking around with hangboards.

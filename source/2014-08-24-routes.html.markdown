Today, I climbed my first routes. 

Started with a 5.5, ended with a 5.8+. Never have I felt so stoked to climb that grade. 

Climbing in a boot is hard. I wasn't sure how much weight it would bear, so I gingerly weighted it when necessary, but avoided it as much as I could. Luckily, it all felt ok and there were no problems. I think I could handle some ARC workouts, especially once I get the boot off. 

After that (and a few ladders), I walked on the treadmill for 0.5 mi. Not a lot, I'll admit, but boredom took over. It's technically the longest I've walked so far, so that's something. It's cool to see that it didn't cause any pain.

Today, I traded my boot for a nice lace-up fabric ankle brace. I can now walk with two real shoes on. 

Damn it feels good to be a gangsta.

It still feels sore when I walk, but I expect that'll diminish over the next few weeks. I wouldn't be surprised if I have nagging soreness for a year or so -- maybe forever. On one hand, that's a bummer, but on the other I'm stoked to be moving freely again. A few points over the past few months put that into question. 

Tonight's my gym night, but I'm going to pass. I'm going to celebrate with a beer.

Second day climbing since the accident, first time with two shoes on. Ran up a few sub 5.10 routes at TRC. 

During today's session, I vacillated between feeling ready for 10s and 11s ... and feeling like I couldn't put more than average weight on the left foot. A few times I caught myself foot-swapping and stepping through to avoid weighting the ankle. 

Over time this will dissipate. 

After climbing, I set up my counterweight system and easily did a few 1-armed pullups with -35# weight. I need to drop this weight over the coming weeks and get down to zero. 

It felt great to get out on the wall again. The hangboard training definitely kept my fitness up and I didn't get pumped at all. Coming home felt like I hadn't even worked out.

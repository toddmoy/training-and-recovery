Second day climbing since the accident, first time with two shoes on. Ran up a ffew sub 5.10 routes at TRC. 

During today's session, I vacillated between feeling ready for 10s and 11s ... and feeling like I couldn't put more than average weight on the left foot. A few times I caught myself foot-swapping and stepping through to avoid weighting the ankle. 

Over time this will dissipate. 

Regardless, it felt great to get out on the wall again. The hangboard training definitely kept my fitness up and I didn't get pumped at all. Coming home felt like I hadn't even worked out.

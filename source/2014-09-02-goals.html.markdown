Back on July 10, I set up a goal... 

*By December 2014, I want to top-rope a 5.11 in TRC Morrisville's new tall extension.*

...and some intermediate objectives... 

1. Find a dedicated partner / partners by mid-September.
1. Be able to walk unaided by September.
1. Be able to weight my left foot entirely by October.
1. Be able to start climbing walls by mid-September.
1. Be able to climb 5.7 - 5.11 on the shorter walls.

I think this will be done by end of September, and that's not even being dangerously audacious. Here's what's left to do:

Wow. 

After a pretty stressful day, I made a beeline directly to the gym. After a longer-than-usual warmup--most of which was due to being preoccupied and exhausted from work--I set to work. 

I cut out all hangboard exercises and favored campusing. I ran through a ton of sets, including some new exercises like 1-3-5 and dynos. Felt good and felt strong. 

In addition, I added a footwork circuit on the system wall. I still don't have a great routine down yet, but I think this will be important to rebuilding the foot strength, dexterity, and precision that I've lost. 

Most of the routine was doable, but it still hurt a bit to weight my left foot. Doing a dropknee on that foot was out of the question. 

Overall, I feel like some of the toe and outer foot pain is subsiding with use. The heel pain is no longer present, and flexion feels good and pain-free. There's still some work to be done on ROM, but we're talking about a few degrees here and there; it's not much to deal with. 

Psyched!

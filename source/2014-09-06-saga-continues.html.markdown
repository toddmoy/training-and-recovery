Looking back on things over the past few months, one positive outcome from being broken up is an increase in both strength and resolve. 

Strength came through just showing up and getting to work. Nothing more, nothing less. Each week, I came in at least three times, usually four, sometimes five. I made some noticeable improvements one-day-at-a-time. I'm not a beast for sure, but definitely stronger than when I went in. 

The change in my resolve surprised me the most. Supplementary exercises -- hangboard, campus board, core -- aren't exactly fun compared to actual climbing. But stripped of the ability to climb, those exercises became my new norm. Doing workouts became tolerable, even somewhat fun. Perhaps my expectations got dialed down. 

Still though, I'm thankful that I stuck to my guns and kept training. I think this will become a large part of my regimen as I get back onto the wall. And, deep down, I feel like I might emerge as a stronger climber overall. 

Time will tell.

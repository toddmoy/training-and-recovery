Hiked Sal's Branch at Umstead. This trail is 2.8 mi over moderate/easy terrain like roots, scree, and some small hills.

While it hurt to walk the trail, it wasn't totally debilitating. My ankle somehow didn't swell up, which was good. 

This marks the longest walk I've done. Come to think of it, I don't think I've walked more than a half-mile over paved ground up to this point. So, this is a pretty nice victory.

A little belated, but whatever. 

Over the last few days, I've been up in NY visiting Amy. While I was up there, we hiked Kaaterskill Falls, a one mile out-and-back trail that led to -- surprise, surprise -- some waterfalls. Good times, great scenery.

I was particularly pumped about how well my ankle did. The trail had a lot of uneven ground that required high-stepping, rock-hopping, careful balancing, and so forth. It was definitely more than I expected and I had a bit of trepidation, but it all went down with flying colors. 

This seems like a checkpoint passed, especially for feeling comfortable with an approach over mixed terrain.

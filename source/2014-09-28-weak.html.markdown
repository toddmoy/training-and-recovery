Last week, my schedule got very disrupted because I was travelling for work. I missed my regular workouts. 

My foot is continuing to progress in strength. At the gym today, I spent some time on the inverted balance ball and I could tell things were feeling more stable. 

After that (and a hangboard sesh) I set to work on some 12s. 

Let's just say that it was a pretty bad day. I strugged up most stuff and failed to complete others. I think the hangboard session before had something to do with this. Nonetheless, I noticed I wasn't getting my body in the right positions often enough. I was also favoring my right foot more than the left, which makes sense.

Overall, I was pretty dissatisfied with the day. Hopefully, the next session won't be as bad.

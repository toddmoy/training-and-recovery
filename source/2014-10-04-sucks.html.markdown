I still haven't gotten back on schedule and that bothers me. But rather than wallow in something unproductive, lets focus on something more interesting. 

Today was the first day I started bouldering again.

Because I'm still leery of taking falls or substantial drops, I invented some problems that kept me no more than 4' off the ground. Props to [TRC](http://trianglerockclub.com) for having some terrain that makes this possible. 

The hangboard and campus training have done some good, but I'm realizing that I need to focus training on actual climbing. Mostly, I feel that I've lost a ton of strength in those unusual positions that come up only on routes -- and I need to get that back.

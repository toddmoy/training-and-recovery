Today, I: 

- Flashed various 11s and 11+s
- Flashed a 5.12-
- Redpointed (2nd try but 1st today) a 5.12
- Worked the moves on another 12 and think it'll go in the next session. 

Looking back at July's goals, I've completed everything. 

- By December 2014, I want to top-rope a 5.11 in TRC Morrisville's new tall extension.
    - Find a dedicated partner / partners by mid-September.
    - Be able to walk unaided by September.
    - Be able to weight my left foot entirely by October.
    - Be able to start climbing walls by mid-September.
    - Be able to climb 5.7 - 5.11 on the shorter walls.

At the time, they felt unreachable, but that was largely due to uncertainty about my health. Since that seems to be shaping up now, it's time to set some new goals--those that feel every bit as unreachable.

Stay tuned.

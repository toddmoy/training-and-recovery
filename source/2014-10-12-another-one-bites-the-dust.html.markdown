Another 12 down. All total, it took three tries in three sessions. I went in with the goal of taking it down and sent it immediately.

After that, I one-hung a few other 12s. All seemed doable, but I just needed to suss out the moves better. In one case, a draw got hung on my harness and caused me to stop. Feels good man.

My foot seems to be doing a lot better. While it gets sore still, it usually feels really solid. I think the PT might have strengthened it more than the other ankle.

Tomorrow I go in for my second post-surgery checkup. Fingers crossed that there's no signs of necrosis or anything else.

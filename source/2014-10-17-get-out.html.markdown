So I'm in Boulder and my quick climbing trip got cancelled. Bummer. But at any rate, I revisited this video which got me more psyched than ever to get out and start leading again.

Aside from that, I got the following report from the xray reader: 

```
FINDINGS and IMPRESSION:
Mild heterogeneous mineralization of the talus, in keeping with
healing/healed talar fracture. Talar dome is normal in configuration. No
evidence of avascular necrosis. No new fractures. Congruent ankle mortise.
Preserved joint spaces. Unchanged mild posttraumatic heterotopic
ossification along the distal margin of the medial malleolus. Unremarkable
soft tissues.
```

TLDR : Good news.

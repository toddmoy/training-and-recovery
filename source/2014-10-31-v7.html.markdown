Well, I think I'm at a point where "recovery" is no longer the most important aspect of this blog. I started bouldering again a few days ago and tonight I sent a V7, a V5, and made progress to the final move on others in that range. 

So I'm going to retire this blog soon. I'll probably come up with a better wrap up post later. But for now, looking back over the past few months, I want to reflect on a few things.

I started this log for two reasons. First, I wanted to understand what I should expect when faced with serious surgery and an uncertain prognosis for recovery. I wasn't finding those details anywhere, so I created this diary so that others in similar situations might know what to expect. The most significant design decision to complement this goal is that posts are presented in "days since my injury". I admit the content isn't great, but hopefully seeing how things progress will be helpful to others.

Second, I wanted to track progress. This turned out to be less important over time since I used pen and paper to capture daily routines and changes. While that detail isn't _here_, I find it enlightening to compare posts in order to see how "insurmountable" issues ended up resolving themselves in only a few days or weeks. There's a larger life lesson in there that speaks to blind perseverence and the expectation that things do work out over time.

Last night I led my first 5.12. It was my second day leading, and first day leading anything hard. It was also my second time on that route and the first time I got it clean. Overall, things went pretty well. I missed a clip and had to backtrack, which made me pump out a bit, but I ended up finishing the route with energy. Later, I was one poorly judged move away from another 12 onsight.

Things seem to be getting better. I still need to take a good, unexpected fall, but otherwise my lead head is coming back.

Tonight I refined this coming quarter's training plan. It'll be the first time I've really followed the RPTM, and I'm excited to see how it'll work out. I'm now realizing the time commitment involved and I hope I have the desire and strength to persevere through it. 

Saturday will be my first ARC session. I'm surprisingly excited about this.
